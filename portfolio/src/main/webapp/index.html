      <h2>About </h2>
      <div class="about">
      <p>My name is Sherry Liu and I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at Drexel Univeristy.</p>
      <p>I'm originally from New York. During high school, I participated in a career development program that provided a gateway to the stem field. There, I
        had my first-hand experience in computing and used new software tools to build products. I discovered my interest in problem-solving through code, so 
        I decided to pursue a major in CS.
      </p>
      <p >In my personal time, I love to watch movies, visit cafes, and go on mid-day drives. I also love learning new skills and these days, I've been into cooking. 
        Since summer is around the corner, my goal is to explore new places and enjoy the weather. My hidden talent is that I am good at building/assembling things, 
        so I would like to think I can survive perfectly fine in a deserted island.</p>
